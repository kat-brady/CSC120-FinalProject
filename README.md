 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

    Our team approached the project collaboratively, leveraging each member's strengths and expertise. We began by brainstorming ideas and defining project goals together. Through regular communication and coordination, we divided tasks based on individual skills and interests while ensuring alignment with the project objectives.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

    While working on this project, we learned about game design principles, text-based game mechanics, and effective command parsing techniques. We also gained insights into object-oriented programming concepts and how to apply them to create scalable and maintainable code.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

    Reflecting on our implementation, there were instances where we could have improved coordination and integration between different components developed by team members. Establishing clear interfaces and conventions early on would have facilitated smoother integration and reduced conflicts during integration phases.
    We initially considered using instances of a generic Room class instead of separate child classes for each room to simplify the design. However, due to the divergent functionalities and unique characteristics of each room, we opted for separate classes to maintain clarity, readability, and facilitate effective team collaboration. This approach allowed for clearer code organization, easier understanding of room-specific functionalities, and minimized conflicts in github during development and integration.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

    If we had unlimited time, we would implement features such as a more dynamic and immersive storyline with branching narratives, additional rooms and puzzles to explore, character customization options, and multiplayer functionality for cooperative or competitive gameplay.


 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

    The most helpful feedback came from regular team meetings and code reviews. Constructive criticism and peer reviews helped identify areas for improvement and encouraged continuous learning and growth within the team.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

    If we could go back in time, we would advise ourselves to not make things overcomplicated. Simplifying the approach and focusing on core functionalities can often lead to more efficient development and a better user experience.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

    Our team dynamics influenced our experience significantly, shaping how we collaborated, communicated, and resolved challenges. Effective teamwork relied on open communication, mutual respect, and a shared commitment to the project's success. Building trust and camaraderie among team members fostered a supportive and productive working environment, enhancing our collective ability to overcome obstacles and achieve our goals.
